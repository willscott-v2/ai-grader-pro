# AI Grader Pro - Roadmap

Product roadmap and future enhancements for AI Search Readiness analysis tool.

---

## Current Status: MVP Complete ✅

The MVP includes:
- Web interface for URL + keyword analysis
- Three-step analysis: Entity Discovery, Keyword Expansion, AI Visibility Check
- Testing across 3 AI engines: Perplexity, ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews
- Comprehensive markdown reports with detailed metrics
- Schema analysis and E-E-A-T scoring
- Real-time progress tracking via SSE

## Post-MVP Iterations

### 1. Prompt Validation & Optimization
**Priority**: Low (wait for user feedback)
**Status**: Research phase
**File**: `lib/analyzer/keyword-expander.js`

**Current State**:
- Prompts generated by Claude are conversational and natural
- No explicit length constraints or validation
- Potentially longer than typical search queries (but may be appropriate for AI search)

**Rationale for Waiting**:
AI search is more conversational than traditional search. While traditional Google searches average 2-3 words, AI search queries typically range 6-15 words. Our current prompts may actually be realistic for AI search behavior.

**Future Enhancement** (when user feedback indicates need):

**Quick Win Option** (~30 minutes):
1. Sample real queries from:
   - Google "People Also Ask" sections
   - Perplexity Discover trending searches
   - Client's own site search data
2. Calculate average word count
3. Update prompt with findings: "Aim for X-Y words based on typical AI search patterns"

**Full Implementation** (~2-4 hours):
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Scrape Google PAA questions for relevant keywords
   - Analyze Perplexity trending education searches
   - Build corpus of 50-100 real AI search queries

2. **Validation Function**:
   ```javascript
   function validatePrompt(prompt) {
     const wordCount = prompt.split(/\s+/).length;
     const hasCompoundClauses = /,|;|\band\b.*\band\b/i.test(prompt);

     return {
       isValid: wordCount <= 15 && !hasCompoundClauses,
       wordCount,
       recommendation: wordCount > 15 ? 'Consider shortening' : 'Good length'
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Report Enhancement**:
   Add "Test Methodology" section showing:
   - Average prompt length used in analysis
   - Shortest/longest prompts
   - Give clients transparency into testing approach

**Optimization Triggers** (when to actually implement):
- ✅ Multiple clients mention prompts feel unnatural
- ✅ Pattern emerges where shorter prompts get better citation rates
- ✅ Consistent zero-citation results suggest prompt issues

**Resources**:
- [MS MARCO Dataset](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/) - Natural language questions
- [Google Natural Questions](https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions/) - Real search queries
- [Perplexity Blog](https://blog.perplexity.ai/) - AI search behavior insights

## Future Feature Ideas

### 2. Competitor Benchmarking
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Idea phase

Compare client's AI visibility against competitors:
- Input: List of competitor URLs
- Output: Comparative citation rates, ranking positions
- Identify which competitors are "winning" in AI search

### 3. Batch Analysis
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Idea phase

Analyze multiple URLs/keywords in one session:
- Upload CSV of URLs + keywords
- Queue-based processing
- Summary report across all analyses

### 4. Historical Tracking
**Priority**: High (after initial client feedback)
**Status**: Requires planning

Track AI visibility changes over time:
- Store analysis results in Supabase
- Monthly/quarterly re-analysis
- Trend graphs showing citation rate improvements
- Alert when rankings change

**Technical Requirements**:
- Supabase tables: `analyses`, `visibility_snapshots`, `historical_trends`
- Dashboard showing time-series data
- Email alerts for significant changes

### 5. Recommendation Implementation Tracking
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Idea phase

Help clients track which recommendations they've implemented:
- Checklist interface for each recommendation
- Before/after analysis comparison
- ROI calculation: "After implementing X, citation rate improved Y%"

### 6. API Access
**Priority**: Low
**Status**: Idea phase

Programmatic access for agencies/large clients:
- REST API for analysis requests
- Webhook callbacks for results
- Rate limiting and API key management

### 7. White Label Options
**Priority**: TBD (based on business model)
**Status**: Idea phase

For agencies who want to resell:
- Custom branding in reports
- Remove "Powered by AI Grader Pro" footer
- Custom domain deployment
